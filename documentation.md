# Introduction

Students nowadays have to juggle several activities and it is difficult to perform at the best in all of them, especially for the unexperienced younger ones. For this reason, students must organise themselves in the most optimal way possible to avoid losing time and perform excellently at the same time. Usually this implies they will have to dedicate more time to the essential tasks and less to others, sometimes leading to completely ignore the less significant ones. For some students, a task that is usually considered secondary is taking care of their health through the food they eat. Most students have poor diets, usually fast-food products, which increase their food expenses, which also cause health problems in the long run.

The aim of this web app is to solve the problems identified in the first three stages of the design thinking process. The ideation of this prototype occurred when trying to provide a hypothesise on how to solve students’ lack of organisation and equipping them with a platform where they can plan their meals during the week, get nutritional informations about the food and create an organised and methodical shopping list.

This phase is an experimental stage where I had to produce the platform that could offer a solution to the obstacles found. The goal of this phase is to understand the user’s behaviour and interaction with the end products.
The ultimate phase is to test the outcome of the decision taken in the previous stages. This will aim to gather more data about the users’ behaviour and needs and therefore redefine the stages and tackle the additional problems in the same systematic way that have been approached the first time.

This app has an obvious purpose of helping students during meal preparation or grocery shopping. Most of the time, users will use this app while moving through shops or while focused on something else, like cooking, hence the decision to use a mobile first approach. Therefore, a mobile first design and prototyping have been prioritized in order to give the best performance when the user needs those features the most.



# Methodology

# ![prototype-methodology](src/assets/prototypeMethodology.png) 
<!-- The Prototype Methodology is the software development process that allows developers to create only the prototype of the solution to demonstrate its functionality to the clients. Make all the necessary modifications before developing the actual application using this methodology. The best feature of this software development methodology is that it solves a plethora of issues that often occur in a traditional waterfall model.

Advantages of Prototype Model

Show the prototype to the client to have a clear understanding and complete ‘feel’ of the functionality developed in the software. It ensures a greater level of customer satisfaction and comfort.
Identify the scope of the refinement and accordingly accommodate new changes in the given requirements.
Significantly reduce the risk of failure using this method and identify the potential risks at an early stage and moderation steps can be taken quickly.
The communication between the software development team and the client makes a very good and conducive environment during a project.
It helps in requirement gathering and requirement analysis when there is a lack of required documents.
Disadvantages of Prototype Model

Prototyping is usually done at the cost of the developer, so it should be done using minimal resources otherwise the organization’s development cost stretches too much.
Customers sometimes demand the actual product to be delivered soon after seeing an early prototype.
The clients have too much involvement which is not always aligned with the software developer.
It does not appreciate too many modifications in the project as it easily disturbs the existing workflow of the entire software development process.
Customers may not be satisfied or interested in the product after seeing the initial prototype. -->

### Methods
This prototype proposed has been evaluated by the users using an online questionnaire that required them to use the app with no previous knowledge about how to use it. The purpose was to understand the user behaviour and find any problems in the way they approach and use the web-app. The choice of a questionnaire has been implemented because of its ability to transform data into quantitatively provable results.

The questionnaire comprised 10 questions meant to understand the users’ interaction with the app and see if any of the problems established during the first steps of the Design Thinking method can be solved with the proposed prototype.

# Conclusion/Results

The results from the questionnaire brought a promising outcome. Since most of the students agreed with the potential usefulness of the app, I can argue this app could improve the way young people and especially students, approach diets, grocery and personal macronutrients intake care.

All the users have been proven able to create an account, log in and use recipes without prior explanation or tour through the app. Furthermore, the interviewed individuals have been able to add recipes to the shopping list and calendar in an easy and approachable manner. All the students have used the Navbar to browse through the different pages in the app and access the required page.
