### Introduction

Students nowadays have to juggle several activities and it is not easy to perform at the best in all of them, especially for the unexperienced younger ones. For this reason students must organise themselves in the most optimal way possible to avoid losing time and perform excellently at the same time. Usually this implies they will have to dedicate more time to the essential tasks and less to others, sometimes leading to completely ignore the less significant ones. For some students a task that is usually considered secondary is taking care of their health through the food they eat. Most students have poor diets, usually fast-food products which means they spend more on food and which can also cause health problems. 

This aim of this web app is to solve the problems identified in the first three stages of the design thinking process. The ideation of this prototype came when trying to provide a possible hypothesises on how to solve students' lack of organisation and providing them with a platform where they can plan their meals during the week, get nutritional informations about the food and create an organised and methodical shopping list.

This phase is an experimental phase where I had to produce the platform that could produce a possible solution to the obstacles finded. The goal of this phase is to understand the user's behaviour and interaction with the end products.

The final phase is to test the outcome of the decision taken in the previous stages. This will aim to gather more data about the users' behaviour adn needs and therefore redefine the stages and tackle the new problems in the same systematic way that have been approached the first time.
